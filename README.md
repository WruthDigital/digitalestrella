Digital Estrella y Javascript
Use these JavaScript interview questions and answers to help you practice and test your (or another job candidate’s) understanding of this popular programming language used in numerous modern frameworks.

In this guide, we break down the most important and most common JavaScript interview questions to know into three sections:

    Basic JavaScript Interview Questions
    Intermediate JavaScript Interview Questions
    Advanced JavaScript Interview Questions

But, we don’t just give you the technical answer — you can head to any JavaScript tutorial or JS learning website for those.

Rather, on top of the standard technical answer, we give you the reasoning behind the question: why is the interviewer asking me this? What do they really want to know by asking me this question? How can my interview answer best respond to their question?

And, at the end of the article (as well as a few places throughout), we’ll link you to some other helpful interview advice and job hunting guides.
